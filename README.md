# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher – Cyber Security Internship Task 1

A simple yet powerful Python tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the **Caesar Cipher**, built as part of my internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🔐 Encrypts and decrypts messages with a custom shift value
- 🔠 Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- 🧹 Preserves spaces, numbers, and special characters
- 🛡️ Validates user input for mode and shift values

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open a terminal or Python IDE (like Thonny or Replit)
2. Navigate to the folder containing the file `caesar_cipher.py`
3. Run the script:
4. You'll be guided to:
   - Choose encryption or decryption
   - Enter your message
   - Set a shift value between 0–25

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
